# 🔐 Okta Clone – Identity Authentication System (Inspired by Okta)

> 🚀 *Built by a technical recruiter turned future solution engineer.*

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **functional clone of Okta's authentication system**, designed to help me deeply understand modern identity and access management platforms. The aim is to replicate the **core features of Okta**—such as user registration, login, password reset, and role-based access—using **Firebase Authentication** and **React.js**, while documenting every step from a **Solution Engineering** perspective.

## 🎯 Why This Project?

As a former **technical recruiter** for top-tier product companies, I’ve had a front-row seat to what makes great engineers and great solutions. Inspired by a friend working at **Okta**, I decided to build this clone to:

* Transition into a **Solution Engineer** role.
* Learn how to **analyze, design, build, and explain** a complex technical system.
* Document and present like a **solution-driven technologist**.
